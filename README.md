# AccessibilityHomework

For this Assigment we where learning the updated tags and how to the replace the old ones with the new ones. Also I learned that good reusable code that is user friendly has good line spacing so that it is re-readable and easy to make improvments to so, I added comments and made sure that that names of the variables where good and descriptive.
